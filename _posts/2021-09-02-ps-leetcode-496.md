### [ 496. Next Greater Element I ](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/) - Easy

#### 문제

The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

#### 제한사항

- 1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000
- 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104
- All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
- All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.

#### 입출력 예

```
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

```
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

#### 풀이
- String

```go
func nextGreaterElement(nums1 []int, nums2 []int) []int {
    var result []int
    for _, num1Value := range(nums1) {
        compStart := false
        findValue := -1
        for _, num2Value := range(nums2) {
            if (compStart && num1Value < num2Value) {
                findValue = num2Value
                break
            }
            
            if (num1Value == num2Value) {
                compStart = true;
            }
        }
        result = append(result, findValue)
    }
    return result
}
