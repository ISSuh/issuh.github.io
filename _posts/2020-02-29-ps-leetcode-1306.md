### [ 1306. Jump Game III ](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-iii/) - medium

#### 문제

Given an array of non-negative integers arr, you are initially positioned at start index of the array.

When you are at index i, you can jump to i + arr[i] or i - arr[i], check if you can reach to any index with value 0.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.

#### 제한사항
  
#### 입출력 예

```
Example 1:

Input: arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 
All possible ways to reach at index 3 with value 0 are: 
index 5 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3 
index 5 -> index 6 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3 
```
```
Example 2:

Input: arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 0
Output: true 
Explanation: 
One possible way to reach at index 3 with value 0 is: 
index 0 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3
```
```
Example 3:

Input: arr = [3,0,2,1,2], start = 2
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to reach at index 1 with value 0.
```

#### 풀이
  - DFS, BFS

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canReach(vector<int>& arr, int start) {
        stack<int> s;
        // checker for avoid visited twice
        vector<bool> visited(arr.size(), true);
        
        // DFS
        s.push(start);
        while(!s.empty()){
            auto index = s.top();
            s.pop();
            
            // set 'true' on now index;
            visited[index] = false;
            
            // found 
            if(arr[index] == 0)
                return true;
            
            // jump left from now index as much as now index's value 
            int leftIndex = index - arr[index];
            if(leftIndex >= 0 && visited[leftIndex])
                s.push(leftIndex);
            
            // jump right from now index as much as now index's value 
            int rightIndex = index + arr[index];
            if(rightIndex < arr.size() && visited[rightIndex])
                s.push(rightIndex);
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```
