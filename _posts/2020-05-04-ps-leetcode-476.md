### [ 476. Number Complement ](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/) - easy

#### 문제

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

#### 제한사항

- The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
- You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.

#### 입출력 예

```
Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```

```
Example 2:

Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```

#### 풀이
- Bit Manipulate

```go
func findComplement(num int) int {
    mask := ^0
    
    for ; (num & mask) > 0 ; mask <<= 1 {}
    
    return (^mask) ^ num;
}
```
