### [771. Jewels and Stones ](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/) - easy

#### 문제

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

#### 제한사항

- S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
- The characters in J are distinct.

#### 입출력 예

```
Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

```
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

#### 풀이
- Hash

```go
func numJewelsInStones(J string, S string) int {
    result := 0
    m := make(map[rune]int)
    
    for _, v := range(J) {
        m[v]++
    }
    
    for _,v := range(S) {
        _, exist := m[v]
        if(exist) {
            result++
        }
    }
    
    return result
}
```
