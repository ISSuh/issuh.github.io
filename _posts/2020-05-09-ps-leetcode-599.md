### [ 599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists ](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-index-sum-of-two-lists/) - easy

#### 문제

Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. 

You could assume there always exists an answer. 

#### 제한사항

- The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].
- The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].
- The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.
- No duplicates in both lists.

```
Example 1:

Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]

Example 2:

Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).

- Hash

```go
func findRestaurant(list1 []string, list2 []string) []string {
    min := math.MaxInt32
    
    list2Map := make(map[string]int)
    interestRateMap := make(map[int][]string)
    
    for i, v := range list2 {
        list2Map[v] = i
    }
    
    for i, v := range list1 {
        val, exist := list2Map[v]
        
        if exist {
            calInterestRate := i + val
            interestRateMap[calInterestRate] = append(interestRateMap[calInterestRate], v)
            
            if calInterestRate < min {
                min = calInterestRate
            }            
        }
    }

    return interestRateMap[min]
}
```
