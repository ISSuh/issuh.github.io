### [ 461. Hamming Distance ](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/) - easy

#### 문제

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

#### 제한사항
- 0 ≤ x, y < 231.

#### 입출력 예
  
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int count = 0;
        int temp = x ^ y;
        
        while(temp){
            temp = temp & (temp-1);
            ++count;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
