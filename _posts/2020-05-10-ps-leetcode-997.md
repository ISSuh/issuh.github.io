### [ 997. Find the Town Judge ](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/) - easy

#### 문제

In a town, there are N people labelled from 1 to N.  There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given trust, an array of pairs trust[i] = [a, b] representing that the person labelled a trusts the person labelled b.

If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge.  Otherwise, return -1.

#### 제한사항

  - 1 <= N <= 1000
  - trust.length <= 10000
  - trust[i] are all different
  - trust[i][0] != trust[i][1]
  - 1 <= trust[i][0], trust[i][1] <= N

#### 입출력 예

```
Example 1:

Input: N = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
```

```
Example 2:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
```

```
Example 3:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
```
```
Example 4:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: -1
```

```
Example 5:

Input: N = 4, trust = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[4,3]]
Output: 3
```

#### 풀이
  - Array

```go
func findJudge(N int, trust [][]int) int {
    item := make([][]int, N+1)
    for i := range item {
        item[i] = make([]int, N+1)
    }
    
    for _, row := range trust {
        item[row[0]][row[1]] = 1
    }
    
    for i := 1 ; i <= N ; i++ {
        for j := 1 ; j <=N ; j += 1 {
            item[0][i] += item[j][i];
            item[i][0] += item[i][j];
        }
    }
    
    for i := 1 ; i <= N ; i++ {
        if(item[0][i] == N-1 && item[i][0] == 0) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    
    return -1
}
```
